## [2.6.9] - 2026-02-21

### 🎮 Polish & Integration Update - Hints, Arc Tracking, Sound & Cascade VFX

This release delivers the "What's Next" items from v2.6.8: expanded preparation hints, automatic story-arc quest tracking, sound effect hooks for UI events, and cascade combo visual feedback.

#### **Expanded Quest Preparation Hints** 📜
- Added preparation hints to 8 additional quests across Books 1–3:
  - `side_013_book1` (Wall Between Worlds) — exploration danger warning
  - `side_015_book1` (Survival Under Stone) — stealth/political survival tips
  - `book2_018` (Into the Enemy's Lair) — Hybern infiltration briefing
  - `book2_019` (The Cauldron) — ancient power encounter warning
  - `book3_015` (The First Clash) — large-scale battle preparation
  - `book3_016` (Into the Heart) — Cauldron strike mission briefing
  - `book3_018` (The Final Battle) — final boss encounter tips
  - `book3_020` (The King Falls) — King of Hybern boss fight tactics

#### **Automatic Quest Tracking via StoryManager** 🗺️
- Added `NotifyArcQuestProgress(StoryArc)` to `StoryManager` — maps each of the 10 story arcs to a milestone quest/objective and calls `QuestManager.UpdateQuestObjectiveProgress()` automatically
- `UnlockContentForArc()` now calls `NotifyArcQuestProgress()` at completion, firing progress notifications and sound without any manual wiring

#### **Sound Effects for UI Events** 🔊
- `CombatUI` confirmation dialog: plays `"confirm_open"` on show, `"confirm_yes"` on confirm, `"confirm_no"` on cancel
- `InventoryUI` confirmation dialog: same three sound hooks
- `QuestManager.StartQuest()`: plays `"quest_start"` when a new quest begins
- `QuestManager.CompleteQuest()`: plays `"quest_complete"` on quest completion
- `QuestManager.UpdateQuestObjectiveProgress()`: plays `"quest_progress"` on objective tracking
- All calls use `AudioManager.Instance?.PlayUISFXByName()` — null-safe, no audio required

#### **Cascade Combo Visual + Audio Feedback** ⚡
- `CombatUI.OnEnemyTargeted()` now checks `CombatSystem.WasLastAttackCascade()` after each physical attack
- On cascade: fires `ScreenEffectsManager.Instance?.AlertPulse()` for screen visual and `AudioManager.Instance?.PlayUISFXByName("combo_cascade")` for audio

---


### 🎮 UI/UX Enhancements - Quest Hints, Comparisons & Confirmations

This release focuses on improving the player-facing UI experience with four targeted improvements: combat preparation hints, mid-quest progress notifications, equipment comparison tooltips, and confirmation dialogs for critical actions.

#### **Quest Preparation Hints in CombatUI** ⚔️
- Added `questHintPanel`, `questHintText`, and `dismissHintButton` fields to `CombatUI`
- Added `ShowActiveQuestPreparationHint()` – finds the first active quest with a `preparationHint` and displays it when combat starts
- Added `DismissQuestHint()` – hides the hint panel when player clicks dismiss
- Boss fight hints already defined in `Book1Quests.cs` (Middengard Wyrm, Naga) are now visible to players

#### **Mid-Quest Progress Notifications via QuestManager** 📜
- Added `UpdateQuestObjectiveProgress(questId, objectiveIndex)` to `QuestManager` – marks an objective as done and sends a `NotificationSystem.ShowQuest()` notification showing current progress (e.g., "✓ Defeat the Wyrm (1/3)")
- `StartQuest()` now fires `NotificationSystem.ShowQuest("New Quest", quest.title)` when a quest begins
- `CompleteQuest()` now fires `NotificationSystem.ShowSuccess(...)` with XP reward info on completion

#### **Equipment Comparison Tooltips in InventoryUI** 🔍
- Added `comparisonPanel`, `comparisonHeaderText`, and `comparisonStatsText` fields to `InventoryUI`
- Added `ShowEquipmentComparison(item)` – shown automatically when selecting a Weapon or Armor item; compares Power and Value vs. currently equipped item with color-coded +/- deltas
- Added `FormatDiff(int)` helper that formats stat diffs as `<color=green>+N</color>` / `<color=red>-N</color>`
- Added `GetEquippedWeaponItem()` and `GetEquippedArmorItem()` to `InventorySystem` – return the full `Item` object for comparison (previously only the ID was accessible)

#### **Confirmation Dialogs for Critical Actions** ✅
- **CombatUI**: Flee action now opens a confirmation dialog ("Flee from combat? You may lose progress!") before executing. New fields: `confirmationPanel`, `confirmationMessageText`, `confirmYesButton`, `confirmNoButton`. New methods: `ShowConfirmation()`, `OnConfirmYes()`, `OnConfirmNo()`, `ExecuteFlee()`
- **InventoryUI**: Drop item action now opens a confirmation dialog ("Drop [item]? This cannot be undone.") before executing. Same pattern with new fields and methods: `ShowConfirmation()`, `ExecuteDrop()`, `OnConfirmYes()`, `OnConfirmNo()`
- Both dialogs fall back to direct execution if no confirmation panel is assigned in the Inspector

#### **Files Modified**
- `Assets/Scripts/CombatUI.cs` – quest hints, confirmation dialog
- `Assets/Scripts/QuestManager.cs` – progress notifications, quest start/complete notifications
- `Assets/Scripts/InventoryUI.cs` – equipment comparison, drop confirmation
- `Assets/Scripts/InventorySystem.cs` – new `GetEquippedWeaponItem()` / `GetEquippedArmorItem()` methods

#### **Backward Compatibility** ✅
- All new UI fields are optional with null checks; game works without them assigned
- `UpdateQuestObjectiveProgress()` is a new method that callers can opt into
- `GetEquippedWeaponItem()` / `GetEquippedArmorItem()` are additive APIs
- No breaking changes to existing method signatures
