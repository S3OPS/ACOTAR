## 🎮 Project Overview

### What is ACOTAR RPG?

ACOTAR Fantasy RPG is a fan-made, lore-accurate fantasy role-playing game based on Sarah J. Maas's *"A Court of Thorns and Roses"* series. The game recreates the magical world of Prythian with its seven High Fae Courts, diverse character classes, and rich magic system.

### Key Features

- **7 High Fae Courts**: Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter, Night, Dawn, and Day
- **6 Character Classes**: High Fae, Lesser Fae, Human, Illyrian, Attor, and Suriel
- **12 Magic Types**: Including Winnowing, Shapeshifting, Daemati, and elemental powers
- **Quest System**: Main story quests, side quests, court quests, and companion quests
- **Location System**: Explore iconic locations like Velaris, Under the Mountain, and the Spring Court Manor
- **Character Progression**: XP-based leveling system with stat growth
- **Combat System**: Turn-based combat with physical and magical attacks
- **Inventory System**: Item collection, equipment, and consumables
- **Save/Load System**: Persistent game state across sessions

### Technology Stack

- **Engine**: Unity 2022.3.0f1
- **Language**: C# (.NET Standard 2.1)
- **Architecture**: Component-based with Singleton pattern for managers
- **Serialization**: JSON for save data
- **Build System**: Docker-based cross-platform builds
- **Version Control**: Git/GitHub

---

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design

### Design Patterns

#### 1. Singleton Pattern
The `GameManager` uses the Singleton pattern to ensure only one instance exists throughout the game lifecycle.

```csharp
public static GameManager Instance { get; private set; }

private void Awake()
{
    if (Instance == null)
    {
        Instance = this;
        DontDestroyOnLoad(gameObject);
    }
    else
    {
        Destroy(gameObject);
    }
}
```

#### 2. Manager Pattern
Core game functionality is organized into specialized managers:
- **GameManager**: Orchestrates overall game flow
- **LocationManager**: Handles all location-related operations
- **QuestManager**: Manages quest progression

#### 3. Event-Driven Architecture
`GameEvents` provides a centralized event system for loose coupling:
- Character events (level up, transformation, damage)
- Location events (travel)
- Court events (allegiance changes)
- Quest events (started, completed)

#### 4. Modular Component Design
Game logic is broken into focused, reusable modules:
- **CharacterStats**: Encapsulates all stat-related logic
- **AbilitySystem**: Manages magic abilities
- **CombatSystem**: Handles combat calculations
- **InventorySystem**: Manages items and equipment
- **SaveSystem**: Handles game state persistence

- O(1) instead of O(n) for repeat queries
- Location name list cached
- Cache invalidation on location addition

### 3. Modular Stat Calculations
- Stats initialized once per character class
- No repeated calculations during gameplay
- Property accessors provide clean interface
- Internal optimization hidden from API

### 4. Event-Driven Updates
- Reduces tight coupling between systems
- Systems subscribe only to relevant events
- No polling or update loops needed
- Clean separation of concerns

### 5. Dictionary-Based Storage
- O(1) lookup for locations by name
- O(1) lookup for quests by ID
- O(1) lookup for items by ID
- Minimal memory overhead
